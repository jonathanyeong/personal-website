You find yourself in a familiar situation: starting a new job, excitedly setting up a fresh codebase, only to encounter a mysterious, undocumented error. You turn to your onboarding buddy for help. They speak the dreaded words, "weird - works on my machine". A response that leaves you navigating a labyrinth of debugging all by your lonesome. Okay I'm being a little dramatic, but we've all experienced these "works on my machine" moments that can send us spiraling. Thankfully, at Shopify we used cloud developer environments (CDEs) to do our development. While I can't replicate everything that Shopify did with their tooling, I can make my own personal development a little smoother. We'll go over my Github Codespace workflow, the pros and cons and other alternatives out there.
