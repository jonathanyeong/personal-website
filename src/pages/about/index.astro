        Hiya, my name's Jonathan Yeong ðŸ‘‹.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-6">
        I'm a Staff Software Engineer at Flexport, previously, Shopify. Currently, based in Toronto, Canada.
        I've worked with Ruby and Typescript across both microservices and monoliths.
        I have lukewarm opinions on architecture but strong opinions on developer experience.
        My passion lies with mentoring and coaching others.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-6">
        I've been a mentor at
        <a href="https://the-collab-lab.codes/" class="text-link">The Collab Lab</a>,
        and frequent the <a href="https://virtualcoffee.io/" class="text-link">Virtual Coffee community</a>.
        I also spent a year stint as a manager.
        Where I realized how much more I could help those around me. I also found out the hard way
        how easy it was to burn out - a story for another time!
      </p>

      <p class="mb-6">
        I also tinker with a
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/jonathanyeong" class="text-link">Youtube channel</a>, build in public on <a href="https://github.com/jonathanyeong" class="text-link">Github</a>, and
        infrequently post on
        <a href="https://hachyderm.io/@jonathanyeong" class="text-link" rel="me">Mastodon</a>,
        and <a href="https://twitter.com/JonoYeong" class="text-link">Twitter</a>. If you're interested
        in working with me, or chatting about anything developer you can DM me on socials or
        email me at hey[@]jonathanyeong.com.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Fun fact:</b> It's taken me 32 years but I finally know how to keep plants alive ðŸŒ¿.
